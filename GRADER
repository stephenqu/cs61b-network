Name of student running submit: Brian Pugh

Third team member's name (if any): Stephen Qu
Third team member's login: cs61b-fn

IMPORTANT:  Once you've submitted Project 2 once, the same team member should
submit always.  If a different teammate must submit, inform cs61b@cory.eecs of
all the details.  Include a complete list of team members, and let us know
which submission you want graded.

If you've submitted your project once, or even written a substantial amount of
code together, you may not change partners without the permission of the
instructor.
===============================================================================
Does your program compile without errors?


Have you tested your program on the machines in the Soda CS 61B lab?


Did you successfully implement game tree search?  Did you successfully
implement alpha-beta pruning?  Are there any limitations on it?  What is the
default number of search levels set by the one-parameter MachinePlayer
constructor?


Describe your board evaluation function in some detail.


Does your MachinePlayer use any special method of choosing the first few moves?


Is there anything else the graders should know to help them read your project?



Describe the classes, modules, and interfaces you designed before and while you
implemented the project.  Your description should include:
  -  A list of the classes your program uses.
  -  A list of each of the "modules" used in or by MachinePlayer, similar to
     the list in the "Teamwork" section of the README (but hopefully more
     detailed).
  -  For each module, list the class(es) the module is implemented in.
  -  For each module, say which of your team members implemented it.
  -  For each module, describe its interface--specifically, the prototype and
     behavior of each method that is available for external callers (outside
     the module) to call.  Don't include methods that are only meant to be
     called from within the module.

     For each method, provide (1) a method prototype and (2) a complete,
     unambiguous description of the behavior of the method/module.  This
     description should also appear before the method in your code's comments.

You will probably need to change some of your design decisions as you go; be
sure to modify this file to reflect these changes before you submit your
project.  Your design of classes and interfaces with be worth about 10% of your
grade.

Classes:
Board
Player
  MachinePlayer
  RandomPlayer
Move
Piece

Modules:
  -BOARD CLASS
  1. Valid Moves Module
     Module for the purpose of determining a valid move.
     public boolean validMove(Move m) (Brian)
     Decides if the Move m is a valid move on this board. It will have to check if the 'from' position is valid, then if the 'to' position can be moved to, specifically whether it will not replace an opponent's piece or create a group of 3 adjacent pieces or add a third piece to a goal or place a piece in the opponent's goal. This can use a call to testInvariants() to see if the move will break any invariants.

     public Move[] validMoves(Move m)
     Generates a list of all valid moves without calling validMove. We may decide to have MachinePlayer keep an array of references to all pieces it has placed, that it will return all "places" to empty spots and all "steps" from placed pieces.

     public boolean makesCluster(Piece)
     Determines if a Piece placed at that location would create a cluster.

     public boolean inOpponentGoal(Piece)
     Determines if a hypothetical Piece would be in the opponent's goal.

     public boolean inBounds(int, int)
     Determines if the coordinates given are within the Board.

  2. Winning Network Module (Allen)
     Module for the purpose of determining a winner.

     public int winner()
     Returns the color of the winner or -1 if there is not winner yet. Tests
     this by looking for winning networks.
     (Lots of private methods, classes, etc. behind this)
     THESE PRIVATE METHODS ARE NOT DOCUMENTED IN THE SOURCE CODE.

     private DList findWinningNetworks()
     Returns a doubly-linked list of any networks.

     private Network findNetwork(Piece)
     Finds a network (if it exists) from Piece.

     private Network findNetwork(Piece[])
     Finds a network (if it exists) that starts with the ordered Piece[].

     private boolean isInEndZone(Piece)
     Determines if a Piece is in the end zone.

     private boolean isInFarEndZoneIfAlreadyInEndZone(Piece)
     Determines if they are in the bottom or top end zone.

     private static boolean containsPiece(Piece[], Piece)
     Returns whether the Piece[] contains Piece.

     private static Piece[] appendToPieceArray(Piece[], Piece)
     Returns a Piece array with Piece appended to Piece[].

     private static boolean inRayPath(Piece[], Piece)
     Returns whether the last two Pieces in Piece[] and Piece are colinear.

     private class Network
     Internal representation of a Network.

  3. General Board Class Module (Brian)
     Module to support represenations of Boards

     Some methods:
     public void doMove(Move m)
     Executes the move M if it is valid. This will change the board, not create a new one.

     public int getNextPlayer()
     Returns the color of the player who will go next.

     public int getNumMoves();
     Returns the number of moves elapsed, for use in the chooseMove() method of MachinePlayer.

     public int getDimension()
     Returns the side length of the Board (always 8)

     public int otherPlayer()
     Returns the color of the other player (i.e. WHITE --> BLACK)

     public boolean addPiece(Piece)
     Adds a piece, returns if sucessful. For debug purposes.

     public boolean removePiece(Piece)
     Removes a piece, returns if sucessful. For debug purposes.

     private boolean testInvariants()
     (used for debugging)
     Asserts that the invariants are true, throwing an AssertionError if they are not.

  4. toString Module (Allen)
     Module to display a text representation of Board.
     public String toString();
     Not hard. For debugging.

  5. Connected Pieces Module (Stephen)
     Module to find connected pieces.
     public DList findPieceConnections(Piece)
     Takes a position and returns an array of all pieces that are the closest to it in each of the 8 directions. First it will get an array of all of the closest pieces, then it will filter out those of the wrong color.

  -PIECE CLASS
  1. Piece Representation (Allen)
    Module to support internal representations inside Board.
     Basic internal representation of a Piece.
     Write a constructor and getters and setters for X, Y, and the color. Moves will be processed by changing Position fields, not references. (Unless we find some security problems with this way)

  -MACHINEPLAYER CLASS

  1. Choose Move Module (Stephen)
     public Move chooseMove()
     This is a minimax game tree method with alpha-beta pruning that decides what move to take. It will contain an internal recursive helper method.

     private class Best
     Class to help us out with finding best moves.

  2. Board Evaluation Module (Brian)
     public double boardEval(Board b)
     Assigns a board a value from -1 to 1 where -1 means black has won and 1 means white has won and everything in between is an ongoing game where an advantage determines the closeness to -1 or to 1.

  3. Moving Module (Brian)
     Implement opponentMove() and forceMove()
     Each will use the doMove() method in the Board class, which updates Position fields.
